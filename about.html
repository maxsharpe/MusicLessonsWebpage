	<p> Steve Stanzione: Creator of the revolutionary Steve's Kwikstep Music Learning Method </p>
	<p>In the summer of 1982, at the age of 16, I taught my first guitar lesson. I then attended Five Towns College and Berklee College of Music on a full tuition scholarship.</p>
	<p> I teach guitar, bass and piano using my Kwikstep Music Learning Method. </p>
	<p>As a student of music lessons for many years, there were two issues I often heard. One was the teacher was awesome but most of the students were average. The second was that students were rarely, if ever, taught anything that interested them. </p>
	<p>In addition to addressing these two ideas, I developed the cornerstones of my business which are now more important than ever. These are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A Commitment to 100% Satisfaction</li>
		<li>Offering the Advantage of a Unique, Specialized Service</li>
	</ul>
